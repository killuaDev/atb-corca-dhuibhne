# Introduction
What's in this book is a short account fo the most important traits of the Irish of Corca Dhuihne. It will be useful for students who are attending courses on the spoken languages and to others who are interested in the Gaeltacht and the Irish of the Gaeltacht.

The principal parts of speech are described and samples from living speech are given as demonstartion the whole way through. Examples and forms of words in the dialect were put in italics, and the spelling was amended to show the pronunciation more clearly. These samples are based on material collected by the author in Corca Dhuibhne for the past 20 years.

An account of the adverbs or the conjunctions couldn't be done in a short work like this, but certain adverbs will be found in the chapter on vocabulary. That chapter contains a personal selection of the author, and it's certain that absences will be noted, but the information presented  there should be interesting nevertheless.

I'm truly grateful to the people in Corca Dhuibhne whose sepeech I've studied, and to the following people who read drafts of this work: Pádraig Ua Maoileoin above any body else, plus Liam P. Ó Murchú, Pádraig Tyers and Dónall P. Ó Baoill. I'm also grateful to Seán Ua Súilleabháin for sharing his knolwedge and opinions with me, and to Áine Ní Chonghaile who typset the text.
