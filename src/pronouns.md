# 4. Pronouns
## 4.1 The two types of personal pronouns.
The personal pronouns have two groups of forms. The dependent pronouns make up a part of the analytic forms of verbs (*be mé* etc.) and the independent forms are used everywhere else.

## 4.2 The independent pronouns 
These are the forms along with the emphatic forms:

|     |      |       |         |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ------- |
| *mi*  | *sinn* | *mise*  | *sinne*   |
| *tu*  | *sibh* | *tusa*  | *sibhse*  |
| *é*   | *iad*  | *é sin* | *iad son* |
| *í*   |      | *í sin* |         |

Note:
- Short vowel in *mi, tu*
- No *s* in *é, í, iad*
- Emphatic in the third person with *sin, son* (stressed)

The following are the two biggest uses of the independent forms:

With the copula:
+ (a) *An mise atá uait?*
	+ *Ní tu.*
+ (b) *An tu bhí amuigh anson ó chiainibh?*
	+ *Ní mi, go deimhin.*
+ (c) *Nách é siúd a bhí ag caint leat?*
	+ *Ní hé.*

As the object of a verb:
+ *Neacaig éinne mi*
+ *Ní chreitig éinne tu/thu*
+ *Ní cheannófar go deo iad*

Regarding the variation between *tu* and *thu*, *thu* is an optional form (mostly after vowels) and it might be being overtaken by *tu.*

## 4.3 The dependent pronouns
These are the forms:

|     |      |
| --- | ---- |
| *mé*  | ---  |
| *tú*  | *sibh* |
| *sé*  | *siad* |
| *sí*  |      |

These forms come directly after a verb form acting as a subject. They're shown here in the future tense of the verb *dineann,* and notice that there's an option between some of them and a verb suffix:

|                    |                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| *déanha mé/déanhad*  | *déanhaimid*           |
| *déanha tú/déanhair* | *déanha sibh*          |
| *déanha sé/sí*       | *déanha siad/déanhaid* | 

When the subject pronoun of a verb is put at the start with the copula, the independent form is used:
+ *Is mi a dhéanhaig é.*
+ *Ní hé a dhéanhaig é.*

The following is how the subject pronoun of the verb is emphasised; note that *mise* isn't used:

|                          |                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| *déanhadsa*              | *déanhaimidna*    |
| *déanha tusa/déanhairse* | *déanha sibhse*   |
| *déanha sé/sí sin*       | *déanha siad son* | 

The synthetic form in the 3rd person plural (*déanhaid*) is most often used in responses and it **does not** get emphasised.

Here are some examples of the dependent form:
+ *Cíhi mé arís tu*
+ *Caileann tú a' dul?*
+ *Be sé ceathach*
+ *Déanha sé sin maitheas duit*
+ *Ghlaeig sí orm ó chiainibh*
+ *Ní déarha siad faic*

## 4.4 The demonstrative pronoun
These are used to refer to people and sometimes to things:
+ *so*
+ *son/sun*
+ *súd*

For example:
+ *Cabhróig so leat (= sé seo)*
+ *Tá son ana-dheacair a shásamh (= sé sin)*
+ *Bhí súd leis ann (= sé siúd)*

It seems that these forms only refer to males. *sé seo, sé sin, sé siúd* can be said as alternatives to them. The difference in meaning between *son/sun* and *súd* isn't always very clear, and it might be that they are being mixed in speech.
