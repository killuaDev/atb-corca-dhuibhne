# Translator's Note
I translated this book because I think access to dialectal information is very helpful to those just beginning to learn Irish, if you start only learning about dialectal traits when you're able to read books like this in Irish, I think you're starting too late.

It's likely I've made typos and mistakes throughout the translation, please let me know if you see any. I often tried to maintain the original formatting of the book however messy that may have been, keep that in mind.

The original is available in Irish under the name *An Teanga Bheo - Corca Dhuibhne* written by Diarmuid Ó Sé, it's an amazing resource and I'd highly recommend it if you can read Irish.

I apologise for the guerilla nature of this translation, if anyone involved in the making of the book would like me to take this down, just let me know and I will.
